# Sales Insights Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis and visualization process for a computer hardware business, AtliQ Hardware. Faced with a rapidly changing market, the sales director decided to invest in a data analysis project to gain real-time sales insights using Tableau. This project is carried out with the goal of understanding the work of a real-life Data Analyst. It is processed in a manner as to visualise the real life process of the project.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Introduction
I began with a discussion of the problem statement, where the sales director identified the need for a real-time sales insights dashboard to navigate market challenges.

### 2. Project Planning and Data Discovery
In the initial phase, the sales director mets with the IT director and data analytics team to plan the project using the AIMS grid. The AIMS grid helped define the purpose and success criteria for the project. Following this, the data analyst team collaborated with the IT team to discover the necessary data stored in a MySQL database.

### 3. Data Discovery and ETL Concepts
I explored the MySQL database managed by the database team, which contains all sales transactions, customer information, products, and market data. The project emphasized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and introduced concepts of OLTP, OLAP, and data warehousing.

### 4. Connecting MySQL with Tableau
In this phase, I connected the MySQL database with Tableau and performed essential data cleaning and ETL operations, also known as data munging or data wrangling. This included tasks like currency normalization and handling invalid values to prepare the data for visualization.

### 5. Building the Tableau Dashboard
I created a comprehensive Tableau dashboard, covering:
- **Sheet vs. Dashboard**: Understanding the difference and usage.
- **Label Summarization**: Summarizing revenue and sales quantity.
- **Bar Charts**: Creating bar charts for various measures.
- **Filters**: Adding year and month filter buttons.
- **Revenue Trend Chart**: Visualizing revenue trends over time.
- **Final Dashboard**: Combining individual sheets into a cohesive dashboard.
- **Publishing**: Publishing the dashboard to Tableau Online for accessibility.

### 6. Feedback and Phase 2 Development
After deploying the initial dashboard, the sales director provided feedback, leading to the development of Phase 2. This phase focused on profit analysis and addressing any issues identified in Phase 1.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL (MySQL)**: For data extraction and management.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Project Goals
- Provide real-time sales insights to the sales director.
- Demonstrate the complete lifecycle of a data analysis project.
- Showcase practical applications of ETL processes and data visualization techniques.

## How to Use This Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-insights-data-analysis.git
2. **Set Up the MySQL Database**: Ensure you have the necessary sales data in your MySQL database.

3. **Connect to Tableau**: Follow the steps to connect Tableau to your MySQL database.

4. **Publish and Iterate**: Publish the dashboard and iterate based on user feedback.

## Conclusion
This project offered me a real-world example of how data analysis and visualization can drive business decisions. By following the steps outlined, I gained hands-on experience in project planning, data discovery, ETL processes, and creating actionable insights through Tableau dashboards. In future I intend to take feedback and update the dashboard to have a better practical use case.
